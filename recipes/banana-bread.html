    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This banana nut bread is dense, excellent, and definitely indulgent. It's always completely 
        gone in minutes. This is great at parties, but never lasts long at home. Warning: May be impossible 
        to resist!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream sugar and butter together in a separate bowl. Stir in bananas, eggs, and walnuts until
        well blended.</li>
        <li>Pour wet ingredients into flour mixture and stir just until blended. Divide the batter evenly 
        between the two prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a paring knife inserted into the crown of each loaf comes out 
        clean, 60 to 70 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let loaves cool in the pans for at least 5 minutes. Turn out onto a cooling
        rack, and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve. For more intense flavor, wrap each loaf in aluminum foil to keep in the moisture, then
        refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
