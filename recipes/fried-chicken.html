    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. 
        Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, 
        most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.</p>
    <p>There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency 
            is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside. </li>
        <li>Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying 
            process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat â€” after browning, 
            the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again 
            at the end, locking in that crispy texture. </li>
        <li>Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Make the Breading</h3></li>
        <p>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.</p>
        <li><h3>Dredge the Chicken</h3></li>
        <p>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely 
            soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake 
            well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating 
            to become a paste-like consistency.</p>
        <li><h3>Fry the Chicken</h3></li>
        <p>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the 
            heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and 
            fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.</p>
    </ol>
